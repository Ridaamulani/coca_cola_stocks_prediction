Coca-Cola Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Overview

Stock market movements are inherently unpredictable, but by leveraging historical data and machine learning, we can identify patterns and trends that help make informed predictions. This project focuses on forecasting the closing price of Coca-Cola’s stock (KO) using Random Forest Regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm.

We have developed a fully functional Flask API, allowing users to input stock features and obtain real-time predictions. Whether you are a data enthusiast, developer, or finance professional, this project offers valuable insights into financial market analysis using Python and machine learning.

Project Description

This repository contains a machine learning-based stock price prediction system that forecasts Coca-Cola’s closing stock price using historical data. The project utilizes a Random Forest Regressor for model training and a Flask API for real-time predictions, providing a robust and reliable forecasting system.

Why This Project?

Stock price prediction is a complex yet fascinating field that combines finance, data science, and machine learning. While no model can predict stock prices with absolute certainty, identifying historical patterns can help estimate future trends with reasonable accuracy.

This project demonstrates:

Collecting real-time stock data using Yahoo Finance
