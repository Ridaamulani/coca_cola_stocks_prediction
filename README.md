Coca-Cola Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview

Stock market movements are notoriously unpredictable, but by leveraging historical data and machine learning, we can uncover patterns and trends that help make informed predictions. This project is focused on forecasting the closing price of Coca-Cola’s stock (KO) using Random Forest Regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm.

We have built a fully functional Flask API, allowing users to input stock features and get real-time predictions. Whether you're a data enthusiast, developer, or finance geek, this project will provide valuable insights into financial market analysis using Python and machine learning.

Description

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the closing stock price of Coca-Cola (KO) using historical stock data. The project utilizes Random Forest Regressor for model training and a Flask API for real-time predictions. The goal is to provide a robust and reliable stock price forecasting system.

Why This Project?

Stock price prediction is a complex yet fascinating field that blends finance, data science, and machine learning. While no model can predict the market with 100% accuracy, we can still identify patterns that provide useful estimations.
